<h1>The Blue Nowhere</h1>
<h2>Just a guy learning Python, Bash and Linux.</h2>
<br>
<h3>Command Line Black Belt Session: </h3>
<h4>Day 1:</h4>
<h4>Technical Jargon:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>GUI - Graphical User Interface, you click/drag graphical icons around.</li>
    <br>
    <li>CLI - Command Line Interface, you give instructions, you give instructions to the computer by typing commands.</li>
    <br> 
    <li>Terminal - Also called "terminal emulator", is a program that gives you access to CLI on GUI.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Prompt - The line of text that you see when you open a terminal it generally contains your username and machine's name(hostname) and most likely a $ sign.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Directory - Same as a folder, we will call it a directory from now on.</li>
    <br>
</ol>
<h4>What is the shell?</h4>

<p>
    A shell is an interface for you, the user to interact with the operating system. 
    It is called a shell as it is the outermost layer around the operating system. 
    But you don't need to know much before you can start using the shell, 
    we'll pick up more details about it as we move on! </p>

<h4>Types of shell:</h4>

<p>
    There are many shells available for Linux that can be installed, 
    Zsh, Mksh, Pwsh, Csh, Fish, etc. 
    But Bash is the one we'll be learning about in this series, 
    as it is present by default on most Linux distributions(breeds of Linux :p) 
    like Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL, RockyLinux, OpenSUSE, etc. 
    If you already have access to a Linux machine you can type echo $0 
    to find out which shell you're using
